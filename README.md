# Text-To-Image-Website
# AI Image Generation Web Application

This project is a web application that allows users to generate images from text prompts using the power of AI. It's built with a combination of PHP for the backend, MySQL for the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. A Python application is also integrated for specific tasks.

## Key Features

*   **Image Generation:** Users can input text prompts and generate corresponding images.  The core image generation logic is handled by a Python application (`pythonApp/app.py`) which is called from the PHP backend.
*   **User Authentication:**  The application includes user registration and login functionality, allowing users to manage their generated images and access premium features.
*   **Premium Features:** A premium subscription model is implemented, potentially offering increased image generation quotas, access to advanced models, or other benefits.  Files related to premium functionality include `js/premium.js`, `src/check_premium_expiry.php`, and `src/update_premium.php`.
*   **Image History:** The application tracks and stores the history of images generated by each user, enabling them to revisit previous creations. This functionality is managed by files such as `src/get_image_history.php` and `src/save_image_history.php`.
*   **Admin Panel:** An administrative interface is provided for managing users, models, and potentially other application settings. This panel is accessible through the `admin` directory.
*   **Gmail Integration:** The application integrates with Gmail, possibly for features like sending notifications or exporting data.  Files related to this integration include  `src/gmail_token_manager.php`, `src/gmail_tokens.json`, and `src/reset_gmail_auth.php`. The integration uses OAuth 2.0, with the callback handled by `src/oauth2callback.php`.
*   **Database Migrations:**  Database schema changes are managed through migrations, ensuring a consistent and version-controlled database structure. See `migrations/01_add_model_foreign_key.sql` for an example migration file.

## Technical Stack

*   **Backend:** PHP
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Image Generation:** Python (within `pythonApp/app.py`)

## Directory Structure

*   **`admin/`:** Contains files related to the admin panel.
*   **`css/`:** Stores CSS files for styling the application.
*   **`images/`:** Holds image assets and generated images.
*   **`js/`:** Contains JavaScript files for frontend interactivity.
*   **`migrations/`:** Includes SQL files for database migrations.
*   **`pythonApp/`:**  Houses the Python application responsible for image generation.
*   **`src/`:** Contains the main PHP source code for the application's backend logic.
*   **Root:**  Includes core files like `index.php`, `database.sql`, and configuration files.

## Database

The application uses a MySQL database.  The schema can be found in `database.sql`.  Database interactions are handled within the PHP code, particularly in the files within the `src/` directory.

## API Endpoints (Examples)

*   `/src/generate_image.php`:  Endpoint for triggering image generation.  Accepts a text prompt as input and returns the generated image (or a reference to it).
*   `/src/get_image_history.php`: Endpoint to retrieve the image generation history for a specific user.
*   `/src/login.php`: Endpoint for user login.
*   `/src/register.php`: Endpoint for user registration.
*   (And others - see files in `src/`)

## Setup and Deployment

*(This section would typically include instructions on how to set up the development environment, configure the database, install dependencies, and deploy the application.  Since I don't have access to the full context, I'm omitting these details for now.)*

## Future Enhancements

*(This section would typically outline planned features or improvements. Examples might include: Adding more AI models, improving the user interface, implementing more robust error handling, and expanding premium features.)*

## Contributing

*(If this were an open-source project, this section would provide guidelines for contributing. Since I don't know the context, I'm omitting this.)*
